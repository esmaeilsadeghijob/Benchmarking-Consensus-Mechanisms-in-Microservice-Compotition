# Steps to Implement the Raft Consensus Algorithm

```text
Implementing the Raft consensus algorithm in a microservices architecture using Spring Boot and Netflix Eureka involves creating a cluster of nodes that work together to achieve consensus on the state of the system. The Raft algorithm ensures data consistency across distributed systems by electing a leader and replicating logs to follower nodes.
